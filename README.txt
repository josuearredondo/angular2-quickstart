Overview 

The QuickStart application has the structure of a real-world Angular application and displays the simple message: My First Angular App


This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the angular.io quickstart, the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production. It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular



Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

Get it now if it's not already installed on your machine.

Verify that you are running at least node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors.

Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., my-proj).

git clone  https://github.com/josuearredondo/angular2-quickstart  my-proj

cd my-proj

For discard everything "git-like" you need deleting the .git folder.

rm -rf .git  # non-Windows

rd .git /S/Q # windows
